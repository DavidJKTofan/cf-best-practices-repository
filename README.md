# Cloudflare L7 Best Practices Repository

A web application built with Cloudflare Workers and Cloudflare D1 that provides a searchable repository of security, performance, and reliability best practices for Cloudflare configurations.

> _**Focused on Layer 7 (L7) Application Services**_

## Features

- üîç Search and filter best practices by multiple criteria
- üè∑Ô∏è Category and feature-based organization
- üéØ Detailed configuration examples and expressions
- üìä Impact and difficulty level indicators
- üîí Focus on L7 (application layer) security
- ‚ö° Dashboard to add new entries (protected by Cloudflare Access)

## Technology

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- **Backend**: [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)
- **Database**: [Cloudflare D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/) (SQLite)
- **Authentication**: [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/)
- **Initial Data**: Comprehensive SQL file with best practices for various Cloudflare features and configurations [`initial_data.sql`](initial_data.sql)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers using [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)
3. Initialize D1 database using the [`create_d1_schema.sh`](create_d1_schema.sh) script

```bash
chmod +x create_d1_schema.sh
# For remote deployment (default):
./create_d1_schema.sh --remote
# OR for local development:
./create_d1_schema.sh --local
```

Alternatively, already deploy it remotely and then run `npx wrangler dev --remote` to use the remote D1 database.

4. Configure [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/) to protect the `/dashboard` path


## Access Control

The dashboard for adding new entries is protected by Cloudflare Access:

- Public users can view and search best practices
- Authenticated users can access `/dashboard` to add new entries
- Authentication is handled via Cloudflare Access policies (relevant [tutorial](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/tutorials/extend-sso-with-workers/))

## Data Structure

The repository includes best practices for:

- Categories: `/api/categories`
- Features: `/api/features`
